Welcome to the 2-player Dice Game! (Play here - https://as-7.github.io/Dice-Game/)

First Player to get score of 100 wins!

1. Each player gets a chance to roll a dice and accumulate a score.
2. The player can choose to 'Hold' their score and add it to their total tally
3. If a 'one' appears, your current score will be set to 0 and the other player will play now
4. When you choose to 'Hold' your score, the other player gets the chance as well


Good luck!
